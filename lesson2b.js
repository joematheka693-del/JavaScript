// Comparison Operators
//They usually evaluate to a boolean answer
let number1 = 5
let number2 = 10
let number3 = 20

console.log(number1 == number2)
console.log(number1 >= number2)
console.log(number1 <= number2)
console.log(number1 > number2)
console.log(number1 < number2)
console.log(number1 != number2)
console.log(number1 != number1)


//Logical operators are used to evaluate two or more conditions and they also give a boolean answer
//Logical AND (&&): It evaluates to true if and only if both of the conditions/statements are true
console.log((number1 < number2) && (number2 > number1) && (number3 > number2))

// Logical OR (||) - It evaluates to true if one of the conditions is true.
console.log((number1 > number2) || (number2 > number1))

// Logical NOT (!) - It used to negate a condition/statement 
console.log(!(number1 < number2))

//Triple equal sign - Research in javascript
// In JavaScript, the triple equal sign (===) is called the: Strict Equality Operator
// It is used to compare two values and it checks: Value and Data type
// Both must be the same for it to return true.
 
let number4 = 5
let number5 = "5"

console.log(number4 === number5)
